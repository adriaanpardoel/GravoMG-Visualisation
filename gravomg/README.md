C++ library implementing Gravo MG. Gravo MG is a Geometric Multigrid Method for solving linear systems on curved surfaces. For more information, check out our [project page](https://rubenwiersma.nl/gravomg).

## Linking in CMake
You can add this library to your project by simply including the files in your folder for dependencies (e.g., by using git submodules or CMake fetch content) and then adding the subdirectory to your CMake file:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(deps/gravomg)
target_link_libraries([project_name] PRIVATE gravomg)
```

## Usage
Create the solver and construct a hierarchy:
```cpp
GravoMG::MultigridSolver(positions, neighbors, mass)
solver->buildHierarchy();
```

Solve a linear system
```cpp
Eigen::SparseMatrix<double> lhs;
Eigen::MatrixXd rhs, x;
solver->solve(lhs, rhs, x);
```
